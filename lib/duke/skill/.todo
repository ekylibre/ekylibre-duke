1. Remove Skills as existing currently
2. Create folders for each skill.
3. Inside folder, optionnaly have main duke_article child (ex: current duke_intervention)
4. Create a handler folder (or just throw new files inside skill folder)
5. New files must be handlers for each particular request
  - each file inherits from duke_article or duke_#{skill} 
  - remove methods from duke_#{skill} if method is only used in one of the request, and add it as private method of new handler
  - each file is initialized with an unique arg : [DukeEvent] event
  - each initializer returns a DukeResponse
6. Create a dukeEvent class (takes params[;main_param] from controller as entry)
7. Create a DukeResponse class (response to IBM) which returns a json 
8. Store every regexes in Duke::Utils::Regex 
9. Put refinements & baseDuke inside Duke::Utils
